# bezier-curves-perlin-noise
This p5.js code creates interactive, dynamic Bezier-like curves that respond to mouse movement using Perlin noise for smooth, organic distortions. The animation generates multiple concentric shapes that continuously evolve over time. Created at Creative Code 4 lectures by Igor Rjabinin at AFAD Bratislava.
